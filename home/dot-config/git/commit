# Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to around 72
# characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank
# line seperating the summary from the body is critical (unless you
# omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you
# run the two together.
#
# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not
# "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug". This convention matches up with commit
# messages generated by commands like 'git merge' and 'git revert'.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by
#    a single space, with blank lines inbetween, but conventions vary.
#
#  - Use a hanging indent
